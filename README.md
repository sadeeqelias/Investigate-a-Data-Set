# Investigate-a-Data-Set
## Project: Investigate TMDb Movie Database

###  Introduction
In this project, I'll go through the data analysis process and see how everything fits together. I'll use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib which make writing data analysis code in Python a lot easier! Not only that, these are sought-after skills by employers!


## Project Details
This project contains :

Investigate_a_Dataset.ipynb, the Jupyter Notebook containing all the work.

Dataset file
This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb). Contains data such as title, cast, director, runtime, budget, revenue, release year etc.

- Certain columns, like ‘cast’ and ‘genres’, contain multiple values separated by pipe (|) characters.
- There are some odd characters in the ‘cast’ column. Nothing to care much of, I leave them as is.
- The final two columns ending with “_adj" show the budget and revenue of the associated movie in terms of 2010 dollars, accounting for inflation over time.
Requirements
This project requires ##Python 3## and the following Python libraries installed:

- [Python 3.6.5](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-365/)
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/installing.html)
You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a Jupyter Notebook

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the Anaconda distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included.

## Conclusion
##### What I learned
- What all steps are involved in a typical data analysis process.
- Comfortable posing questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those questions.
- Know how to investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a format that can be used.
- Have practice communicating the results of the analysis.
- Being able to use vectorized operations in NumPy and Pandas to speed up your data analysis code.
- Being familiar with Pandas Series and DataFrame objects, which lets access data more conveniently.
- Last but not least, Know how to use Matplotlib and Seaborn to produce plots showing findings.
